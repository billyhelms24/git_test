We'll call this my first _real_ interaction with **Git**, and using **GitHub**. While it technically isn't, it _is_ my first time taking it seriously.

I am making my way through a self-paced online bootcamp called [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com), that is aimed to teach full-stack web-development. I will be finishing the Full-Stack JavaScript Path first, and will decide upon completion whether to follow the Full-Stack Ruby Path.

Because this repo is the product of [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com), I will use it as a portfolio of sorts. Below, you will find links to the repos for other projects I have completed while following the TOP cirriculum.

# My Projects:

## Google Homepage

An attempted recreation of the famous Google Search page, using only basic HTML/CSS.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

An RPS game that takes place in the browser, against the computer. This project acted as my first taste of what JavaScript can do with DOM Manipulation. The computer uses simple RNG to make a selection whenever the user does. The two selections are compared and scored accordingly, displaying the score on the page.

## Etch-a-Sketch

Taking DOM Manipulation a step further by adding in loops and event listeners. Takes a default base number of 4 and makes a 4x4 grid of square containers that a user can _paint_ by moving their mouse through them. The user can click reset to change the base number used for the size of the grid, which also clears the board of any _paint_.

## Calculator

A calculator built using only HTML/CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. The user can load a number using the numberpad onto the display. When an operation is chosen, that number and operation are loaded into an array. The user can then load another number to the display and then click equals for a result or string together multiple operations.

## Library

A library built using only HTML/CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. This project uses objects, where each book is constructed using the same prototype, and more DOM Manipulation to display them. The library loads with 5 books already, each with a title, author, number of pages, and completion status. Each book has a delete button that removes it from the library, and a change status button that changes the completion status of each individual book. Users can use the form at the bottom of the library to add more books.
