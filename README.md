We'll call this my first _real_ interaction with **Git**, and using **GitHub**. While it technically isn't, it _is_ my first time taking it seriously.

I am making my way through a self-paced online bootcamp called [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com), that is aimed to teach full-stack web-development. I will be finishing the Full-Stack JavaScript Path first, and will decide upon completion whether to follow the Full-Stack Ruby Path.

Because this repo is the product of [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com), I will use it as a portfolio of sorts. Below, you will find links to the repos for other projects I have completed while following the TOP cirriculum.

# My Projects:

## Google Homepage

An attempted recreation of the infamous Google Search page, using only basic HTML/CSS.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors

An RPS game that takes place in the browser, against the computer. This project acted as my first taste of what JavaScript can do with DOM Manipulation. The computer uses simple RNG to make a selection whenever the user does. The two selections are compared and scored accordingly, displaying the score on the page.
