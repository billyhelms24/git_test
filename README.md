We'll call this my first _real_ interaction with **Git**, and using **GitHub**. While it technically isn't, it _is_ my first time taking it seriously.

I am making my way through a self-paced online bootcamp called [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com), that is aimed to teach full-stack web-development. I will be making my way through the Full-Stack JavaScript Path, and will decide upon completion whether to follow the Full-Stack Ruby Path.

Because this repo is the product of [**The Odin Project**](https://www.theodinproject.com), I will use it as a portfolio of sorts. Below, you will find links to the repos for other projects I have completed while following the TOP cirriculum.
